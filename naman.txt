Q1. Imp. features of Java 8(jdk).

Q2. What is jvm? IS it platform independant?
Ans. jvm is Java Virtual Machine

Q3. Diff. b/w jdk, jre and jvm?
Ans. jdk- Java Development Kit
     jre- Jave Runtime Engine
     jvm- Java Virtual Machine.

Q4. Which class is superclass of all the classes?

Q5. Why java doesn't support multiple inheritance?
Ans. Because if we refer to the base class using super or want to use a function of the base class using
     a derived class the class would not know which of the base classes to call.

Q6. Why Java is not pure object oriented language?
Q7. Diff. b/w overloading and overwriting. Can we overload main method?
Ans. Overloading is using the functions of a base class in derived classes. 
     Overriding is changin the functionality of the function in the derived class.

Q8. Diff. access modifiers. Explain with program example.

Q9. Diff. b/w access specifier and access modifier.
Ans. Access specifiers tell which  variables and functions of a class can be accessed
     directly or indirectly(private, public, protected).

Q10. D/b final and static keyword.
Ans. By using the final keyword we set the value of the variable fixed for the whole program.
The static keyword sets the value of the integer unchangable for only one iteration in which 
the variable is.

Q11. Can we declare a class as static?

Q12. D/b abstract classes and interfaces?
Ans. We cannot create objects of abstract classes. Its variables and functions can be used in
     other classes multiple times. Interfaces are used to initialise values of variables for use 
     by different classes.

Q13. Wrapper classes

Q14. Anonymous inner class.

Q15. Ternary operator. Example.

Q16. Super, this, garbage collection, pass by value, pass by reference.
Ans. Super- It refers to the extended class.
     This- It refers to the object used in the previous statement.
     Garbage Collection- The elements which are not in use in the program or the space
     in memory not in use.
     Pass by Value- Passing the value of a variable in a function.
     Pass by Reference- Passing the address of the value of variable in the function.

Write a program to print duplicate elements

Check whether a string is palindrome or not

Print a Triangle

Print series of prime nos. bw 1 to 100.
Ans.
class Codechef

{
int i,n;

    
for(n=1;n<=100;n++)
    
{
        
int flag=0;
        
i=2;
        
while(i<=n/2)
        
{
            
if(n%i==0)
            
{
            
flag=1;
           
 break;
            
}
           
 i++;
        
}
        
if(flag==0)
        
{
            
System.out.println(+n+" ");
       
 }
        
    
}

}
	
public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	
{
		
Codechef obj=new Codechef();
		
obj.Prime();
	
}

}
